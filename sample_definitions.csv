Definition
A test method contains more than one assertion statement without an explanation/message (parameter in the assertion method)
Some duplicated actions appear in multiple places.
"Calling one factory may silently create many associated records, which accumulates to make the whole test suite slow (more on that later)"
All fields of a template are defined by formal parameters.
"Occurs when a test case tests the same condition multiple times, which may increase test overhead."
a conditional expression is unnecessarily nested.
Long test method
"Making hacks that need an explanation or having complicated setups, so that a scenario can be tested"
"Another common cause, especially with ""legacy software"" (defined for our purposes as any software that doesn't have a complete suite of automated tests) is that the design of the software is not conducive to automated testing. This situation is described in more detail in its own smell section, Hard-to-Test Code"
"Consumption of external resources by a test such as, using a file which contains test data."
The test does not compile or cannot be run due to changes in test-independent parts of the production code.
A test contains too many comments
A variable or out parameter is read before a value has been assigned
Two or more similar or identical in-line templates.
A test that interacts with a corresponding class by using another class.
"A test is affected by Eager Test when it checks more than one method of the class to be tested, making the comprehension of the actual test target difficult."
A test that passes (is green) but contains assertions that are never executed
"A test case that uses external resources that are not managed by a fixture. A drawback of this approach is that the interface to external resources might change over time necessitating an update of the test case, or that those resources might not be available when the test case is run, endangering the deterministic behaviour of the test."
"A test allocates resources also used by others also used by others (e.g., tmp files)"
"A test doesn’t validate any behaviour and passes in every scenario. Any new bug introduced in the code will never be discovered by this test. It was probably created after the implementation was finished, so the author of this test couldn’t know whether the test actually tests something."
"Rather than write a new test case method to test another feature or functionality, a new assertion rides along in an existing test case."
"A collection of unexplained assertions in a single test method that, in the event of a test failure, challenge tracing which exact assertion had a problem"
A test case is difficult to understand at a first reading.
A test that has no assertions only exists to lie about code coverage.
