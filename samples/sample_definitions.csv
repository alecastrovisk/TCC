xUnit test patterns: Refactoring test code,book,Test Smell,Hard-to-Test Code,,"Another common cause, especially with ""legacy software"" (defined for our purposes as any software that doesn't have a complete suite of automated tests) is that the design of the software is not conducive to automated testing.

SoCRATES: Scala radar for test smells,paper,Test Smell,Mystery Guest,,"A test case that uses external resources that are not managed by a fixture. A drawback of this approach is that the interface to external resources might change over time necessitating an update of the test case, or that those resources might not be available when the test case is run, endangering the deterministic behaviour of the test.",False,False,False,False
